                    <h3>Decide the Fate of the World</h3>
                    <p>Alliance challenges you and your opponents to decide 
                            the outcome. As one of the world powers 
                            battling for supremacy you must lead your country's
                             military drive; but you can't do it alone. 
                            You have to form alliances and then betray your 
                            allies before they betray you!</p>
                            <p>Decide where to strike, when to strike, and the intensity
                             of the strike. Will it be a bombing 
                            raid, an offshore missile barrage, or an invasion 
                            with land forces and tanks? Plan your attack, 
                            move into enemy territory with your forces and win 
                            the conflict.</p>
                            <p>
                            The economic destiny of your nation is also at stake. 
                            Buy armaments and develop secret 
                            weapons from your country's economic funds and 
                            natural reserves, but be sure to save 
                            something for the future.</p>

                            <h3>Tedious and Confusing</h3>
                            <p>The list of war simulation games is long. All of them 
                                    share similar features including the 
                                    formation of temporary Alliance and battles simulated 
                                    through random draws of a deck or the 
                                    roll of the die. Alliance offers very little that 
                                    is new or innovative in that regard.
                                    <br>
                                    We found the game to be too drawn-out and confusing. 
                                    In fact, I dare say we spent more time 
                                    reading and rereading the rule book than actually 
                                    playing the game. If you want to read a 
                                    book on war, we suggest Sun Tzu.
